    "# 1) Monty: The Python Siri\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's make a Siri-like program (call it Monty!) with the following properties:\n",
    "   - record your voice command\n",
    "   - use a webservice to parse that sound file into text\n",
    "   - based on what the text, take three different types of actions:\n",
    "       - send an email to yourself\n",
    "       - do some math\n",
    "       - tell a joke\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, if you say \"Monty: email me with subject hello and body goodbye\", it will email you with the appropriate subject and body. If you say \"Monty: tell me a joke\" then it will go to the web and find a joke and print it for you. If you say, \"Monty: calculate two times three\" it should response with printing the number 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: you can use speed-to-text apps like Houndify (or, e.g., Google Speech https://cloud.google.com/speech/) to return the text (but not do the actions). You'll need to sign up for a free API and then follow documentation instructions for using the service within Python. "
